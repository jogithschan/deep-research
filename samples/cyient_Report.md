### Final Investment Guidance

**For Existing Shareholders:**
- **HOLD** current positions; do not add until margin stabilization confirmed
- Set stop-loss at 15-20% below current levels to protect against bear case
- Monitor Q1 & Q2 FY26 results closely for DLM segment recovery signals
- Re-evaluate position if EBITDA margin falls below 13% or DLM losses continue

**For Prospective Investors:**
- **WAIT** for clearer evidence of operational turnaround before initiating position
- Consider small starter position (25-33% of intended allocation) if stock corrects another 10-15%
- Ideal entry point: Post Q1/Q2 FY26 results if margins stabilize and DLM shows improvement
- Avoid momentum buying; this is a **show-me story** requiring proof of execution

**Red Flags Requiring Immediate Exit:**
1. EBITDA margin falls below 12% for two consecutive quarters
2. DLM segment reports losses or sub-5% margins in FY26
3. Order book growth turns negative or major client loss announced
4. Management guidance (when provided) significantly below consensus expectations
5. Net cash position deteriorates below ₹8,000 Mn without strategic rationale

**Green Lights for Upgrading to BUY:**
1. Two consecutive quarters of margin expansion (EBITDA >16%)
2. DLM segment profitability returns to ₹25+ Cr quarterly run-rate
3. Semiconductor design wins announced with ₹1,500+ Mn TCV
4. Order book growth accelerates to 15%+ YoY
5. Management provides credible FY26-27 guidance with margin recovery roadmap

---

### Conclusion

Cyient Limited is at a **strategic crossroads**—possessing valuable assets (aerospace relationships, semiconductor partnerships, strong balance sheet) but facing **near-term execution headwinds** that cloud the investment outlook. The company's transformation from pure engineering services to design-led manufacturing and semiconductor ecosystem player is strategically sound but **operationally unproven**.

**The investment case hinges on management's ability to:**
1. Stabilize and recover DLM segment margins
2. Translate strategic partnerships (Boeing, Navitas) into material revenue
3. Demonstrate pricing power and operating leverage as revenue scales

Until these execution milestones are achieved, the stock remains a **HOLD for patient, long-term investors** with tolerance for volatility, and an **AVOID for growth, momentum, or risk-averse investors**. The next 6-9 months will be critical in determining whether Cyient emerges as a differentiated engineering services leader or remains trapped in a margin compression cycle.

**Bottom Line:** Cyient offers **asymmetric upside potential** (bull case +25-40%) if execution improves, but **meaningful downside risk** (bear case -25-40%) if challenges persist. Current risk-reward does not favor aggressive accumulation; **wait for proof of turnaround** before committing significant capital.
